# Genetic Algorithm

## What is GA?

Genetic Algorithm is a particular class of evolutionary algorithm that uses techniques inspired by evolutionary biology such as inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover. Genetic algorithm is also a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory.


## Problem Solving

We are trying to solve the minimization of the function from heuristic function by using Genetic Algorithm, the program that we implement to solve the problem is Python Languange
